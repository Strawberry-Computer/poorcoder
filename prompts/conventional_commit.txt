Please use the conventional commit format:

type(scope): description

Where:
- type: describes the kind of change
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - docs: Documentation changes
  - style: Changes that don't affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc)
  - refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - perf: Changes that improve performance
  - test: Adding or correcting tests
  - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
- scope: (optional) what part of the codebase is affected (e.g., component name)
- description: a short description of the change in present tense, imperative mood

Examples:
- feat(auth): add JWT authentication support
- fix(button): correct event propagation in onClick handler
- docs(readme): update installation instructions

For more complex changes, you can add a blank line after the first line, 
followed by a more detailed description.
